# PS2 Change Led Color

This program changes the color of the LED on the PS2 power button.

## At the moment I have tested this program on my PS2 Slim SCPH-90010 ⚠️, so I do not guarantee that it will work on other models or on PS2 Fat.

# WARNING⚠️!!!

## I am NOT responsible if this program causes damage to your console ⚠️. Use at your own risk!


## I give many thanks to [el_isra](https://github.com/israpps) for telling me where to get the MechaCon SCMD commands, and so I was able to find the SCMD to change the LED color, THANKS ISRAAAAAAA!!!
